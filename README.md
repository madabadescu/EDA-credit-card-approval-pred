# Credit card approval prediction - group project

Credit score cards are used by financial institutions to assess the risk of lending money to credit card applicants. They use personal information and data provided by the applicant to predict the likelihood of default on credit card payments. Banks use this information to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores are a way to objectively measure risk.

Traditionally, credit card scores have been based on historical data. However, when there are significant economic shifts, past models may not be as accurate in predicting risk. These changes represent a challenge in the field and they are the reason for the development of many new models.

We have chosen to predict whether an applicant is a "good" or "bad" client, based on the historical data of their credits and also on their personal information (age, income, education etc.). The difficulty of this task comes from the fact that the definition of "good" or "bad" is not provided, so we need to use various techniques to create our labels.
